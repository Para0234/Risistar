# Risistar Browsergame Engine

Risistar is a free Space Browsergame based on JKroepke's 2Moons, with many more functionalities, including an implementation of OPBE.

Please note that the installation is currently not operational, as the install.sql doesn't reflect the actual state of the game.

WARNING : FRENCH IS THE ONLY WORKING LANGUAGE AS OF RIGHT NOW

## Status of this project

This project is under active development.

## What's New?

This version already has a lot of major differences when compared to its source. Here are some :

-OPBE is the combat engine instead of the default one

-Dark Matter has been completely overhauled with a completely unique twist preventing pay-to-win activities

-a LOT of new ships (including new capital ships, small ships, and so on)

-Classes (Each giving specific bonuses)

-Carrier ships (Ships able to deploy their own fleet of smaller ships during battles, each with their own specializations)

-Achievments (Which are not adapted at all to the current version, ironically...)

-A new blocking mechanic (opposite of the "requirements one") in case you want to add your own things

-Perfect balance (as if anyone was going to believe that one...)
